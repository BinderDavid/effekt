# Values

Values in Effekt are terms that are pure in the sense that they cannot have any side-effecting behaviour. This includes
the usual String, Boolean, Integer, Double and Character literals but also user-custom data types which we will get to
know later on.

```
println(42 * 2)
println(true && false)
println("hello" + "world")
println('k')
```
