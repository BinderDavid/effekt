# Effekt

Compared to other languages with effect handlers (and support for polymorphic effects) the Effekt language
aims to be significantly more lightweight in its concepts.


## Disclaimer: Use at your own risk

**Effekt is a research-level language. We are actively working on it and the language (and everything else) is very likely to change.**

Also, Effekt comes with no warranty and there are (probably) many bugs -- If this does not discourage you, feel free to
play with it and give us your feedback :)

## Installation

You need to have Java (>= 1.8) and Node (>= 10) and npm installed.

The recommended way of installing Effekt is by running:

```
npm install -g https://github.com/b-studios/effekt/releases/latest/download/effekt.tgz
```

Alternatively, you can download the `effekt.tgz` file from [another release](https://github.com/b-studios/effekt/releases) and then run

```
npm install -g effekt.tgz
```

This will make the `effekt` command globally available. You can start the Effekt REPL by entering:

```
> effekt
```

You will soon find more information about how to use Effekt on the website (<http://effekt-lang.org>). For the time being, you can explore the [docs/](https://github.com/b-studios/effekt/tree/master/docs).
